# 📄 GenAI Document Q&A System (RAG-based)

A **Generative AI-powered web application** that allows users to upload documents (PDFs, scanned PDFs, or TXT files) and ask **natural language questions** about the content. This project uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with Google **Gemini** and **Pinecone** to provide accurate, context-aware answers.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload any file (PDF, scanned PDF, or TXT)  
✅ Extract and embed content using Sentence Transformers  
✅ Store and retrieve embeddings using Pinecone  
✅ Ask any question about the uploaded document  
✅ Answers generated by Gemini AI based on real context  
✅ Avoids hallucinations using document-grounded responses  
✅ Intuitive UI built with Streamlit

## 🧠 Architecture: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project follows the RAG pattern:

1. 📝 **User uploads document**
2. 📎 **Text is extracted and chunked**
3. 🧠 **Chunks are embedded into vector form**
4. 📦 **Vectors are stored in Pinecone**
5. ❓ **User asks a question**
6. 🔍 **Relevant chunks are retrieved**
7. 🤖 **Gemini uses the context to generate the answer**
